This file contains notes on how the Baroque algorithm is being created because it is complicated.

To create a full Baroque piece, I looked into how people of the Baroque era created music. A lot of compusers used a technique called "basso continuo" or "figured bass".
This technique involves creating a bass line and then building the rest of your song from that bass line following a set of fairly strict rules. That sounds a lot like 
a program to me.

The rules that a Baroque era bass should follow are:
    - The bass line should follow a key (specified by user)
    - The bass line should begin and end on the tonic of the key it is following (tonic for key of C is C)
    - The bass line should favor stepwise (1 note) motion 
    - When leaps do occur, they should be <= a 5th (preferably a 3rd or 4th), and followed with stepwise motion in the opposite direction.
    - The bass line should implement common base patterns such as descending scales, the circle of fifths progression, or repeating bass ostinatos (short recuring patterns)
    - The bass line should emphasize strong beats (1 & 3 in 4/4, 1 in 3/4, 1 in 2/4, 1 & 4 in 6/8, 1 is stronger than 3) for important harmonic changes
    - The bass line should maintain harmonic rythm changing chords at regular intervals
    - The bass line should utilize cadences, with Authentic (V-I) and Plagal (IV-I) cadences at phrase endings for closure and direction.
    - Baroque music often takes the form of AB or ABA, the bass line should support that form
